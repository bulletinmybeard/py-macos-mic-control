A Python utility that automatically maintains consistent microphone input volume during calls and meetings on macOS. It detects active audio sessions and adjusts the microphone level accordingly, ensuring your voice comes through at an optimal volume level at all times.

## Features

- Automatic detection of calls and meetings through audio sampling
- Smart microphone volume management
- Continuous background monitoring
- Detailed activity logging with configurable path
- Low resource usage
- Native macOS integration
- Configurable via command-line arguments

## Prerequisites

- macOS (tested on 10.15+)
- Python 3.12+
- Poetry (Python dependency manager)

## Installation

1. Install Poetry if you haven't already:
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bulletinmybeard/py-macos-mic-control.git
cd py-macos-mic-control
```

3. Install dependencies using Poetry:
```bash
poetry install
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run with default settings:
```bash
poetry run mic-control
```

Run with custom settings:

Get help:
```bash
poetry run mic-control --help
```

### Example Commands

1. Set custom target volume:
```bash
poetry run mic-control --target-volume 70
```

2. Adjust check intervals:

```

3. Specify custom log location:
```bash
poetry run mic-control --log-path /var/log/mic_control/app.log
```

4. Combine multiple options:
```bash
poetry run mic-control --target-volume 75 --active-interval 4 --log-path ~/logs/mic.log
```

## Technical Details

### Call Detection

The script determines if you're in a call by:
1. Sampling audio input at regular intervals
2. Calculating RMS (Root Mean Square) value of the audio
3. Comparing against a threshold
4. Requiring sustained audio activity (40% of samples) to confirm call status

### Volume Control

Uses macOS's `osascript` to:
- Read current microphone volume
- Set new volume levels
- Maintain target volume during calls

## Troubleshooting

1. If the script can't access your microphone:
    - Check microphone permissions in System Preferences
    - Ensure no other application is exclusively using the microphone

2. If volume adjustments don't work:
    - Verify you have permission to run osascript
    - Check if your microphone supports volume adjustments

3. For logging issues:
    - Ensure write permissions for the log file location
    - Check available disk space
